<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distraction Osteogenesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Distractor</li><li>External Distractor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The distraction osteogenesis market is categorized into internal distractors and external distractors. Internal distractors are surgically implanted devices that promote bone regeneration through internal mechanisms, providing a less visible solution with potentially reduced post-operative complications. In contrast, external distractors are mounted outside the body and are used to gradually move separated bone segments apart, often for longer lengths or in more complex cases. Both types serve vital roles in orthopedic and maxillofacial surgeries, addressing various bone deficiencies and deformities.</p></p>
