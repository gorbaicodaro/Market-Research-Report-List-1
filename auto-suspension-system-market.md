<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Auto Suspension System</li><li>Non-independent Auto Suspension System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The auto suspension system market is divided into two primary types: independent and non-independent suspension systems. Independent auto suspension systems allow each wheel to move independently, enhancing ride comfort and handling by minimizing the impact of road irregularities on the vehicle's body. In contrast, non-independent suspension systems connect the wheels, meaning movement in one wheel affects the others. This type generally offers simpler design and cost-effectiveness but may compromise ride quality and handling compared to independent systems.</p></p>
