<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flax Yarns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flax yarns market is categorized into wet spinning and dry spinning processes. Wet spinning involves dissolving flax fibers in a solvent to create a viscous solution, which is then extruded through a spinneret into a coagulating bath to form yarn. This method produces high-strength fibers suitable for various textiles. In contrast, dry spinning requires the flax fibers to be mixed with a solvent that evaporates after extrusion, resulting in lighter, softer yarns. Both processes cater to different end-use applications in the textile industry.</p></p>
